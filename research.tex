\huge Report: CAUSES OF ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS
\newpage
\abstract 
There is a growing concern about the rising trend in mortality from road traffic accidents in developing countries due to their effect on health care resources and budgets. traffic accident injuries account for high medical care costs. Improvement in road conditions is often promoted, in part, as tool to improve traffic safety. 
\section{Introduction}
Road traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of injuries and death in both developed and developing countries, and for both women and men 
\section{Research problem}
To understand major causes of Road Traffic Accidents so as to find solutions to them.
\section{Research Scope}
The study is about causes of Road Traffic Accidents around Kampala-Uganda.
\section{Causes of road traffic accidents}
Causes are from the three agents involved in accidents; Human Factors(host), road environment, and vehicle state
Following are human causes of RTA's:
\subsection{Drink-driving}
  Drinking alcohol reduces the ability to observe long distance 
objects by 25%; it also lessens the response time for the driver by 10% to 30%.drink-driving accidents can be caused by drivers of all ages, but especially young drivers in 
the 20 to 24 age groups.
\subsection{Over speeding}
Exceeding the speed limit has a harmful effect on road safety issues.\\ RTAs  caused 
by excessive speed lead to increased damage and the injuries are more serious because of 
the nature of kinetic energy.
\subsection{Careless while on road}
Driving or walking carelessly has highly contributed to RTA's with big percentage to the youth.\\ Person concentrates on mobile phones, conversations and others while on road, putting all their focus away from what may happen.\\ These end up causing RTA's killing and injuring many.
\\
Road environment causes:
\subsection{Poor roads}
This applies to all developing countries.\\
Drivers trying to escape pot-holes on roads end up killing pedestrians or head-to-head with other vehicles.\\
\subsection{Street narrowing}
Many roads are narrow compared to the number of vehicles accessing them. This takes people's time on roads and forces them to over speed causing accidents.\\
Vehicle state causes:
\subsection{Tire blowouts}
Most highways are littered with the scattered remains of a tire blowout. Tire blowouts can cause you to lose control of your vehicle, and they are especially dangerous for bigger automobiles like semi-trucks. When encountering a tire blowout, try to maintain control of your vehicle and pull over safely and you will likely avoid a serious car accident.
\subsection{Poor vehicle servicing}
Most vehicle repairers are just learning, making mistakes in process. Vehicles breakdown while moving killing many.
